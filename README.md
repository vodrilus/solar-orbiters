# solar-orbiters
A numerical, Newtonian and very inaccurate simulation of the planets of the Solar system. Also, some asteroids.

Requires Python 3 and pysdl2 installed. May require fiddling. (Windows: E.g. correct SDL2.dll in the System32 directory.)

Keys:
  W / S: pitch down/up
  A / D: yaw left/right
  Q / R: roll left/right
  X / Z: zoom in/out
  H / N: move forward/backward
  I / K: move up/down
  J / L: move left, right
  , / .: increase/decrease simulation speed (gets choppy fast)
